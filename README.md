# 🌸 Flower Species Recognition using Deep Learning

A PyTorch-based deep learning project that classifies images of flowers into five species: **Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower**, and **Tulip** using a convolutional neural network (CNN). This project is beginner-friendly and walks through data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction.
